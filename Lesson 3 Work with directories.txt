Lesson 3: Work with directories

Create directories

First, let's check what we have in our current directory.

ls -l

mkdir myfirstdirectory creates directory with provided name.

Let's create 10 directories, starting with testdir1 to testdir10. How to do it in one command?

mkdir testdir{1..10}

With this syntax we are able to create 10 directories with the name contains numbers from 1 to 10. 
Very handy.

ls -l

In order to create deeper structure, we have to use -p argument. This allows us to create the whole structure, without creating parent directory as first step.

mkdir -p parentdir/childdir{01..100}

In order to change the directory, we need to use cd command. As you can expect, it is Change Directory in short.

cd parentdir

ls

There is another command to be sure where we currently are:
pwd . This command shows your current work directory.

We can come back to the previous directory. We can do it by typing
cd .. .

For example, we will remove the the root directory.

rmdir root

Now we used some arguments

* -r means go recursively through directories (and treat everything as file)

* -f - force. Another words, do not ask, assume the user knows what he is doing.
