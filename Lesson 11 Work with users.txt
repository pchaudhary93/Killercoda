Lesson 11: Work with users 

Introduction to users

Users are the way how we interact with operating system. We need to log in, provide user, password, or (what is definitely better way, and strongly recommended) provide user and ssh key.

Learn, who you are

Ok. Who are we? A user, well, thank you, Captain Obvious, but which one? Sometimes we can read it in our prompt (yes, we can configure prompt to show different things). But how to get this information in a proper way?

whoami

The whoami command shows the user we are logged in.

nother way to learn this information, not only about current user, but any user in the system.

id

A little theory here. UID is an unique User Identifier, which identify this user through the system and determine which resources this user can access.

There is a good practice, even a standard, when UIDs are associated.

* UID 0 is reserved for root.

* 1-99 are reserved for predefined accounts (like games, mail, www-data, sys, bin and more)

* 100-999 reserved for system and administrative accounts.

* 1000+ are reserved for users

GID (Group IDentifier) has the same meaning, but for group. A group is an abstract which combines many users in similar entity (for the same privileges, purpose, actions, etc).
We can find here similar number associations:

* GID 0 is reserved for root.

* 1-99 are reserved for system and application use.

* 100+ are for users.

passwd

The first file is the passwd file.

The structure of this file is as follows:

username:password:UID:GID:description:homedir:shell

* username - obvious, it is the name of the user

* password - password. Many years ago this was the place where password actually was stored. But for security reasons it chaned and now passwords are available in different form, somewhere else. We will go there later. x in this field means that password is encrypted and stored in the other file.

* UID - unique User IDentifier.

* GID - unique Group IDentifier.

* description - this field can contain many information. The real first and last name. Address. Phone number. Role in the organization. You name it.

* homedir - the location named as home directory. This is the "home" of the user, where he logs and stores his data.

* shell - simply speaking, the shell is the program which takes the commands sent by user, interprets it, and return the answer

shadow

The "magic" file. This is "the other file" I reffered to minutes ago. This file contains sensitive information about the user, like password, and other configurations.

Command which show us where the executable is located.
