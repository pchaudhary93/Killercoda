Lesson 12: Your work history 

History in command line

If history is enabled (we will learn how to check and do it in next chapter) we can re-use previous commands.

Arrows

First, we can navigate through history with arrow up anfd arrow down. Please try to find cat .profile using arrows and then execute the command again.

Files

As you can expect, history is configured somewhere.

In our Katacoda system we need to go through .bashrc file.

Variables

The setting from .bashrc file can be changed for single session by changing the valuer of the variables.

We can print our variables using echo command (echo prints data on standard output):

echo $HISTSIZE

Clear history

In order to clear the history, run

history -c

Disable history

In order to disable history, run

set +o history
