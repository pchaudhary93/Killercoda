Lesson 5: Pipes 

The pipes and redirections concept

The concepts is simple, really. The pipes and redirections are used to send (or retrieve) some information sent from one command or script to another command or script. It works on files too. 

Let's think about some examples:

* Count number of lines in the file
* Select unique values from one file and write it in another
* Find occurences of some string in the file or system
* and many more

grep. This command search for given pattern in the output. Output may be the file or output from other command.

grep 'case' .bashrc This command will search for pattern case in a file .bashrc.

wc is a utility for counting words, newlines, bytes. Commonly we use it for counting lines.

When we execute

wc -l .bashrc

it will count how many lines (-l argument) are in our .bashrc file.

sort will sort the output in alphabetical order

sort numbers.txt will sort the prepared file with generated numbers.

By using uniq we can limit the occurences of the same record to only one. But in order to have this done properly, sort is needed, therefore, we need to pipe these one to another.

The pipe |

The structure looks like this:

command1 | command2

command1 | command2 | command3

You need to remember, that > will create file (if not exists) and rewrite all data as fresh file. >> behaves similarly, however, if there is any content in the fill, this redirection will add the output of the command on the end of existing content.

The input redirection, <, is used mostly to redirect content to file. To do some operations.
