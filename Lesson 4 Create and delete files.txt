Lesson 4: Create and delete files 

Create file(s)

In order to create empty file in Linux, we have to use touch command. Let's do it.

touch testfile

Of course, like in previous scenario, we can create multiple files.

touch my{01..100}file

Let's use the wildcard character * to list all of them

ls my*file

Let's now create some structure.

mkdir testdir

 touch testdir/mytest{01..1000} testdir/file{01..1000}

Delete file(s)

We already know the proper command. It is rm.

Vim

Ok, vim is not part of this lesson. But I'd like to make sure, that we understand that touch is not only one way to create files.

Let's run

vim mynewfile

We opened a vim editor. We will have lessons about it later, now it is enough to follow the instructions.

In order to start typing anything in editor (enter insert mode), hit
i .

Put some text, for example

this is my great line

Now, hit ESC key to enter the command mode, and type :wq
