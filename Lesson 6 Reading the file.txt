Lesson 6: Reading the file 

1. cat and vim

cat

The most basic and I think, mostly used command is cat. As usual in linux the name of the file is a kind of contraction of a longer word, in this case - concatenate.

vim and view

Let's be honest. The true linux admin uses vim. Or even more, the true admin uses vi :) most modern distributions contains vi, vim (in fact in most cases, vi is replaced by vim), emacs, nano... here are many text editors available.

It is important to understand one thing. cat just prints the file. vi is fully functional, very powerful text editor.

Right, in order to exit vim, press ESC and then :q - what means quit.

If you changed something in the file and you don't want to save the changes, press :q!.

If you want to save these changes, press :wq - write and quit.

more

The first command which we can use in order to have better experience is more.

less

There is a more sophisticted tool to read the file. It is called less. This command gives us better navigation.

head

It we want to print first lines of the file, we can use head. By default head shows 10 lines.

head testfile

tail

tail does exactly the same thing as heead does, but from the end of the file.
