Lesson 10: Create aliases 

How to use alias

Aliases give us a great possibility to "shape" command line to our needs. Let's suppose, we want to list all files in long format and with hidden files:

ls -al

alias shows all defined aliases in the session.

let's remove the alias created during this lab:

unalias lh

Make alias permanent

We have at least two ways of creating aliases "forever".

First, take a look on .bashrc file.

grep "alias " .bashrc
