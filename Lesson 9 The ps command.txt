Lesson 9: The ps command 

First look on the ps command

As almost everything in Linux, ps is an abbreviation of Process status.

The simplest execution is just without any argument

ps

With ps we can use arguments, quite obvious. But there is a trick. Normally, we use arguments with dash, like ls -l. But ps is different. It accepts argument with and without dash.

Statuses

This list is copied from manual, which I believe are most important to understand.

* D - uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)

* I - Idle kernel thread

* R - running or runnable (on run queue)

* S - interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)

* T - stopped by job control signal

* t - stopped by debugger during the tracing

* X - dead (should never be seen)

* Z - defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent

Some statuses may have the second letter. Let's list the most important

* < - high-priority (not nice to other users)

* N - low-priority (nice to other users)

* s - is a session leader

* l - is multi-threaded

* + - is in the foreground process group

To list all processes, use

ps -A

more information is in manual man ps
