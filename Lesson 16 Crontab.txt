Lesson 16: Crontab

What is crontab

Although the title is about crontab, we start our story from something else - cron.

Set the task in crontab

Before we set the task, we need to learn about syntax. It is easy, but I think, you will need some time to memorize it :)

We have a few elements here, we can go through them, one by one.

* minute defines on which minute scheduler should execute the program. In our example above, it is 1 minute after specified hour.

* hour defines hour for execution. In our example it is 5PM. Yes, Linux takes here 24 hours for a day.

* day of the month as above, but for day in the month. In the example above it is 7th day of the month.

* month as you can expect, the month. It may be a number, or text. In our example it is 4th month, so April. You can use apr.

* weekday final option defines the weekday. In our example it is 2, what means Tuesday. Please remember, Sunday can be defined as 0 and 7 as well.

Logs

Different Linux distribution will log cronjob execution in different logs. Here, in Ubuntu, we need to go through /var/log/syslog.
