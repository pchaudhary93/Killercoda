Lesson 13: Elevate privileges

Normal user

When we log in to Linux we are "normal" user. With limited access to programs, directories, etc.

root

Root is a master of the system. Root can do everything. Simply, it is an admin :)

Change user

Let's check who we are:

whoami

 id

Ok, let's go back to the initial user - root.

exit

CTRL+c will quite the password prompt (or you can try 3 times to login).

exit

grep ^root /etc/passwd

 grep ^root /etc/shadow

The reason is simple. There is no password set for root.

Elevate privileges

When su log us as root, sudo elevates our privileges on behalf of root (let say it this way).

Second method is to interactively use sudo mode and use elevated privileges in the full session (not command by command).

sudo -i

 ps

-i argument means that we want to use sudo with login option, another words, to switch the session to privileged one.

Sudo can be configured. In order to do so, we use /etc/sudoers file. Let's see it.

clear

 cat /etc/sudoers

Edit sudoers file

We can do it simply, by using your editor of choice, like vim:

vim /etc/sudoers.

sudo without password

Ok, let's edit sudoers again with

visudo

and add this line:

student2 ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

It is easily noticeable, that we configured our second user with one difference - NOPASSWD. in this way we informed sudo, that this user doesn't need to confirm himself with password.
